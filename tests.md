# Test Suite Overview

## GameInformationService (src/index.test.ts)
Tests the core service functionality:
- Collector registration
- Game information collection from multiple collectors
- Error handling for failed collectors
- Statistics calculation (total entries, reliability scores)

## Collectors

### BaseCollector (src/collectors/BaseCollector.test.ts)
Base functionality tests for all collectors:
- Source type initialization
- Rate limiting implementation
- Game data entry structure validation
- Basic collection functionality

### FandomCollector (src/collectors/FandomCollector.test.ts)
Tests for Fandom-specific collection:
- Data collection for valid games
- Section extraction (abstract, gameplay, story, development)
- Rate limit handling
- Error handling for non-existent games
- Reliability score calculation based on content length

### GamespotCollector (src/collectors/GamespotCollector.test.ts)
Tests for Gamespot-specific collection:
- Article collection and transformation
- Response validation
- Error handling (rate limits, server errors)
- Content filtering by type
- Rate limiting implementation

### YouTubeCollector (src/collectors/YouTubeCollector.test.ts)
Tests for YouTube-specific collection:
- Transcript extraction and combination
- Channel filtering (verified gaming channels)
- Duration filtering (10-30 minutes)
- Error handling (API quota, invalid keys)
- Rate limiting
- Data structure validation

## Calculators

### ReliabilityCalculator (src/calculators/ReliabilityCalculator.test.ts)
Tests for reliability score calculation:
- Domain-based scoring
  - High scores for known reliable gaming domains (8-10)
  - Medium scores for general gaming domains (6-8)
  - Lower scores for user-generated content (4-6)
  - Default score (4) for unknown domains
- Combined score calculation
  - Weighted scoring based on domain, content length, and freshness
  - Average score calculation for multiple sources
  - Content age penalization
- Error handling for invalid URLs and edge cases

## Integration Tests (src/__tests__/integration.test.ts)
End-to-end testing of the complete system:
- Multi-source data collection
- Error handling across collectors
- Response format consistency
- Duplicate content handling
- Rate limiting across multiple collectors
- System stability under error conditions
- Resource cleanup

## Performance Tests (src/__tests__/performance.test.ts)
System performance validation:
- Response time tests
  - Single request completion within 60 seconds
  - Multiple concurrent requests within time limit
- Concurrent request handling
  - Rate limit maintenance
  - Error isolation
  - Response consistency
- Memory usage tests
  - Single request memory footprint
  - Concurrent request memory efficiency
  - Memory cleanup after completion
- Cache effectiveness tests
  - Cache hit performance
  - Data integrity in cached responses
  - Cache expiration (24 hours)
  - Concurrent request cache handling
